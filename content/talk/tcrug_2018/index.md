I provide the background on fantasy football and define a problem statement that I look to address with this app during an auction draft. I then step through the application of linear-integer programming to the auction optimization problem. I wrap with a demo of the app and a look at next steps.

[WindLogics](http://windlogics.com/) was kind enough to host and record the session. The resulting video is posted on YouTube (link above), though the quality isn't great.
