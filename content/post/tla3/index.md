In the race towards insights, trust at every stage of the analytics value chain is foundational to unlocking the value of data, as well as the technologies that enable analytics. In our [January 2018 research](../../../publication/tla/) of over 200 analytics decision-makers, those defined as “leaders” commonly exhibit trust in their actions, from data collection to data-driven decision-making. In exploring how and why trust plays a role in analytics leadership, we’re publishing this series to dig into several of the critical factors necessary to building the trust needed for analytics leadership, including [organizational design](../../tla1/tla1) and [IT-business alignment](../../tla2/tla2).

As shown in our research, insights-driven cultures are foundational to analytics leadership. Achieving leadership requires new modes of thinking and believing, deeply embedded in an organization’s makeup. In the third installment of our series, we apply the principles of cultural change to understand what business functions can do to become intrinsically data-driven.
