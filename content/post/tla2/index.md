How is functional alignment more critical in driving the value of analytics than the technologies directly powering analytical insights? As discussed in our recent white paper, [Taking the Lead with Analytics](../../../publication/tla/), those delivering sustainable business value from analytics – who we’ve defined as “leaders” — commonly exhibit trust in their actions, from data collection to data-driven decision making.

This blog series aims to extend those insights with a focused look at key themes in the white paper. We [kicked off the series](../../tla1/tla1) by looking at the role that trust plays in organizational structure.
