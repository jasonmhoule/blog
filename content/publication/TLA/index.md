More than 200 business leaders in the U.S. and UK were asked about their experience, priorities, and organizational cultures related to data and analytics (D&A). The results—presented throughout this report—separate the D&A leaders from the laggards and establish the characteristics and actions of the insights-driven businesses setting the pace for global business growth.
